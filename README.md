* Name: Andrew Bonney

* E-Mail Address: s3529361@student.rmit.edu.au

A fact or two about myself is that I didn't always want to work in IT, I have a strong interest in History (especially Military History) and always wanted to be a Historian, but I also had a passion for Technology and in the end chose IT over History, especially since job wise it's easier to get a career in IT. I still study History for fun and watch tons of documentaries.

## Interest in IT

_What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)._

I'm very interested in IT to the point all of my careers in my adult life have been in the IT industry and hoping to keep that way. The moment I truly became interested in IT for a career was my Religious Education teacher in Year 12 telling me about a traineeship offer at my former High school and given the fact I didn't know what I wanted to do outside of High School gave me inspiration. I have nearly two years in IT experience having worked a traineeship in 2014 at my old High School and my current job as an ICT Support Officer for an Aftermarket Automotive/Airconditioning Company.

_Why did you choose to come to RMIT?_

After finishing my traineeship I was given a Certificate III in IT and wanted to expand my skills and further my education to get a better job in IT. Friends, former teachers and colleagues always suggested RMIT and given that RMIT caters to Technology and ease of access through public transport from where I live meant RMIT was the way to go!

_What do you expect to learn during your studies?_

Considering I am in the last semester of my studies for this Degree, I'll go over both what I expected and what I expect going forward. I expected a lot of hands on stuff in the Associate Degree but was met with more theory work than practical, though I have found some of the theory stuf I learnt (networking, programming, coding etc) to be quite relevant to my current line of work. In my last bit of studies I'm expecting to learn about some more HTML, how Virtualisation works in a corporate environment and the benefits it has to offer for the future.

_A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you._

A Senior Systems Administrator in my opinion manages a team of system administrators & other employees of the IT department.  They are responsible for designing, planning, implementing and overseeing system installations, as well as monitoring and maintaining an organisation's servers and assessing new server hardware and software. The reason this position appeals to me is because I would love to manage an IT Department one day after many year experience and a few certificates under my belt to implement a company's network and server infrastructure, especially with Virtualisation involved!

#### _A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position._

The requirements for this position are the following:

- A firm understanding of server hardware and software technology, troubleshooting, and researching new techniques.

- Nearly two years of experience in the IT Industry.

Skills:

-	Microsoft based System Administration (example Active Directory, Group Policy, Microsoft Exchange)

#### _A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can._

The plan for me to obtain the necessary skills, qualifications and experience is to finish my Associate Degree, do a Bachelor Degree in IT at RMIT but do it online so I can continue to work and get experience at my current job. I hope that at somepoint upon concluding my Bachelor and getting a more higher tier job (System Admin compared to say Level 1/2 Support) I will get an MCSE or any relevant Microsoft Certification related to my necessary field of work (be it Systems Administration, Networking etc).

## Personal Profile

### Myers-Briggs Test:

<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">INTJ-T Personality</a> 

#### _What do the results of these tests mean for you?_

I was a bit surprised of some parts of the test because it reflects me very well! More often than not I agreed with the results of the test as I found myself relating to many aspects of it. It reinforces many traits of my personality (Hard-working, determined, Introverted and Independant), however it also serves as a reminder to look out for in regards to my approach with situations in life (such as working with teams and how personality can clash).

#### _How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?_

The Architect Personality may influence me in several ways for better or worse, the good parts are being Hard-Working and Determined which in a team is quite important for someone to have, meaning they can get the work done and want to get the work done. Some of the not so great parts that will influence my behaviour in a bad way is being over analytical in that getting bogged down and overly picky in the finer details of things, which can be quite annoying for your fellow team members!

#### _How should you take this into account when forming a team?_ 

When forming a team, the best way I intend to take into account the pros and con of my personality is to ensure that I don't get worked up in every aspect of a project and not try to get too overly involved in every minor detail of a project with a team.  The Jack of All Trades sort of approach & being Hardworking will in my mind benefit any team I'm part of.

### Learning Style Test

#### _What do the results of these tests mean for you?_

For me, the results of these test honestly don't surprise me at all. While I am hardworking and such, distractions are my weakness especially when working on a task that doesn't engage me or I actually enjoy doing & seek something visual to appease my boredom. I've always preferred visual elements such as powerpoints, having documents and such ready for me to learn from in class instead of just listening to a person speak in a lecture and being expected to take notes and learn that way, it just doesn't click in my mind and I prefer practical ways of learning instead of theory.


#### _How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?_

Being a Visual learner means I need to keep in check the part of me that gets easily distracted when I should be working with others or on a task, as sounds and other things like non-productive activites (eg Phone) means I can lose interest or such.  

#### _How should you take this into account when forming a team?_ 

When forming a team I hope to incorporate parts of my Visual Learning Style that I think will benefit the team such as being neat and tidy, having pictures and other visual elements in a project that I think will be benefical to a team. However I need to make sure I don't get distracted by noise and other things that may wane my attention when forming a team & working with said team.


### One Further Online Test of your choosing:

<img src= "https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/379062178499657784/623890838577217557/unknown.png">

(Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism)

#### _What do the results of these tests mean for you?_

The results of these test mean various things for me and I don't necessarily agree with having a high neuroticism score for example. In my observation from the results of these test scoring high in Conscientiousness & Agreeableness categories is really good for teamwork though perhaps my average score in Openess & Extraversion can limit me from thinking outside the bok & being creative with things, something I'd have to consider going forward.

#### _How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?_

The results will influence me in several ways, I think having a high score in agreeableness means I'd rather cooperate than compete with someone in a team or look out for my own self interest (even during High School when I was "meant" to compete with people for grades, I preferred working with people). Being conscientiousness means bringing my organisation and determination will be a positive thing for the team but keeping my apparent "neuroticism" in check.

#### _How should you take this into account when forming a team?_ 

When forming a team I need to understand my personal constraints and pair up people who do well in Openess and get low scores in Extraversion, that way there's a wide range of personality types where we can play off each other's strengths and weaknesses. I'd have to be wary of people who aren't as "agreeable" as myself and try to compromise when possible so whatever project I have with a team can get sorted out.

## Project Idea

AFL 2020 (iOS & Android)

### Overview

In summary the project will be the creation of a sports game called “AFL 2020” which will be available on iOS & Android only with potential plans for a port on the newest generation of consoles depending on success of the title. As the name implies, the video game will be based on the AFL with all 18 teams in the AFL playable including the VFL, SANFL, WAFL, U18 TAC Cup & AFL with a career mode for the selected team or creating a playable footballer and guiding them through their career, starting from the bottom and rising to the top as a pro footballer.

### Motivation

The interest for this project is due to the severe lagging in AFL sports game representing the current mobile market, the last AFL game on the mobile market was AFL Live 2 released on the iOS on 28th May 2015 & Android on the 26th of September, 2015. Considering the wide interest people have in AFL both casual and hardcore gamers alike needing their fix on the go, it would certainly have a viable audience especially with AFL Live 2 being rated in the Top 6 in Sports games on the Apple Store as of 2019, a new AFL game with better graphics, updated team rosters and improvements to the AI would be quite profitable. 


### Description





### Tools and Technologies

The software required for this project will be the Unity 3D engine, which is programmed using C# and considering this project will be released commercially, the Professional version of Unity will be required which costs $75 per month. The hardware needed to run the Unity engine to model and code the computer with a graphics card that runs DX10 Shader Model 4.0 (Direct X 10), an OS of Windows 7 or greater and ideally a computer(s) with 8-16GB of RAM. Open source software needed will be Visual 2015 with C++ Tools and Windows 10 SDK for the development of this project.

### Skills Required

The skills required will not be just limited to coding the game for this project. Considering AFL is licensed by the AFL there will need to be some skills in brokering license agreement to allow the likeness of players, the sport and AFL brand to be represented in the video game. In addition marketers will be needed to be hired to promote and advertise the game, as well as getting it to the various iOS/Android stores by submitting the various paperwork needed. Finally developers proficient in C# with knowledge of how AFL works to code the game and various animators for modelling of players, stadiums etc.

### Outcome

If the project is successful, AFL 2020 would be released on the Apple Store for iOS Devices (iPhones & Tablets) & Google Play for Android Devices (Phones & Tablets) to be purchased for $15 AUD. The release of this project will fill the void of a severely under looked and underrepresented genre of AFL Videos games on the market, potentially exposing international customers to AFL & Australian culture which would be very positive for the AFL in growing the sport overseas as they have recently in China & New Zealand as well as providing AFL sports lovers with a new AFL game for their favourite mobile device to play as their sporting heroes.
